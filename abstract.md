# Abstract 

The Bechdel Test is a simple measurement designed to assess the representation of women in film. To pass, a movie must have two female characters who have a conversation that is not about a man. The present research aims to use various movie characteristics to predict whether a movie will pass the Bechdel Test. A logistic model was created using genres and release year to predict outcome of the test. Further analysis examined factors including movie budget, IMDB user ratings, and critics' rating scores to predict likelihood of passing the test. 

## should I specify the number of genres?
