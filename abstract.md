# Abstract 

The Bechdel Test is a simple measurement designed to analyze the representation of women in film. To pass, a movie must have two female characters who have a conversation that is not about a man. The present research aims to use genre, release year, movie budget, user ratings, and critics rating scores to predict the probability a movie will pass the test. Logistic regression analysis reveals more recent movies are predicted to have a higher probability of passing the test. For most years, genres such as Romance and Comedy are predicted to have a higher probability of passing, while genres such as Action, Sport, War, and Western are predicted to have a lower probability of passing the test. Although the Bechdel Test has its flaws, the test is a useful metric to bring attention to the roles women hold in film.
